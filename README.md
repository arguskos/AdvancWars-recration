# AdvancWars-recration
I started this project as an exercise in DI using Zenject framework for Unity. 
And for now this not yet full recreation of an original game although all main mechanics are there.
I was trying to build this highly expandable(thaks to Zenject) and hopefully someday I will finish it.

You can already play over the network, with limited amount of units but I will update this as soon as possible.
I am also planning for an AI but this one will not come so soon.
